	<h1>Course Info Questions</h1>
	<p class = "prompt">Who is this course for? (10 points)</p>
	<p class = "prompt">Identify the learner(s) in your course. Describe them in detail. What should they know coming into this course? Identify any prerequisites.</p>

	<p>A learner in this course should have a passion for web development and want to bring their artistic vision to life through the browser.  They should know that this course goes into detail about gradients and animation and be ready to combine both to create great artistic pieces.  Below are the technical prequisites for this course:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Should have a competent or proficient understanding of HTML and CSS.  They should not need assistance in understanding the nitty gritty details of this course, and should already be aware of the existence of CSS gradients and animation.</li>
		<li>An account on codepen.com so they can create and save their coding exercises.  The user can sign up for an account here.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class = "prompt">Demographics: ages, geographic location, employment status, etc. Are they required to take this course or is it something fun to do in their free time?</p> 

	<p>The learner should be above the age of 12 and have the suggested prerequisites to take this course.  This course does not need for the user to be living in a specific location or have a specific emplyment status.  This course can be taken for fun to learn about how to create CSS animations and bring fun ideas to life through the web, as well as to assist in enhancing their existing skills in creating websites.</p>

	<p class = "prompt">What are your learner's goals for taking this course?</p>
	<p>The learner’s goals are to expand their knowledge of CSS to create compelling and moving graphics.  They can use this course to pursue a career in frontend web development, or just for their own personal gain.  For example if they have a hobby in creating CSS art, or would like to make other web projects for themselves.</p>
 
	<p class = "prompt">What are your goals? (10 points)</p>
	<p class = "prompt">What are your goals in teaching this material? These may be overt, like course objectives, or covert, like gaining technological confidence.</p>
	<p>I would like for my learner to be able to come away with new skills in CSS they didn’t have before.  When my learner has an idea for an art piece or experience they would like to create, I hope this course provides them with the skills they need to make it happen.</p>
	<p>I am very passionate about CSS art and creating interactive and compelling web experiences for people.  I believe creating a course and explaining what I already know will solidify my knowledge and confidence in this material.  I believe I will learn even more.</p>

	<p class = "prompt">What should learners remember 2-3 years after taking your course?</p>
	<p>If the learners do not remember the syntax to create CSS gradients or animations, I hope they remember conceptually how CSS can be used to affect webpages.  They should be able to remember the positive impact gradients and animation can have on a composition or webpage.</p>
 
	<p class = "prompt">How do you know they mastered the material? (10 points)</p>
	<p class = "prompt">Describe what they can do, explain, show, or demonstrate that would indicate they've mastered the material you presented. </p>
	<p class = "prompt">This does not mean "the learner will write a 5 paragraph essay about..." This means something else, like "the learner will know which HTML tags to mark up a given document, and explain their tag choices correctly."</p>
	<p class = "prompt">The learner should:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Be able to explain and know how to create linear, radial, conic and repeating gradients and apply that to an HTML element.</li>
		<li>Know, understand and use all of the background properties that affect gradients such as background-size, background-repeat etc.</li>

	<h3 id="css-gradients">CSS Gradients</h3>
 
	<p><b>Types of Gradients</b></p>
	<p>In CSS we can use gradients to add dimension and character to our webpage.  There are 4 types of CSS gradients:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Linear gradients</li>
		<li>Radial gradients</li>
		<li>Conic Gradients</li>
		<li>Repeating Gradients (Repeating Linear, Repeating Radial)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You can apply gradients to the background of any HTML element.  The basic code to apply a gradient to a div for example, would be:</p>

	<code><pre>
			
		CSS:
		
		div{
			width:300px;
			height:300px;
			background: gradient-type(color,color);
		}
	</pre></code>

<h4><b>Linear Gradients</b></h4>

<p>At its most basic, linear gradients display at least 2 colors blending into each other.  However, you can control the position of the colors, and the direction that the gradient goes in. This helps add dimension to HTML elements, and can be used to draw attention to certain elements versus others on the page.</p>

<p>The basic format for a linear-gradient is:</p>

<code>linear-gradient(color,color);</code>

<p><i>Direction</i></p>

<p>We can control the direction the gradient is going in by giving it a degree in the first spot of the parentheses like so.  The degrees you can use range from 0-360deg, and is designated in this format below.</p>

<code>linear-gradient(<i>number</i>deg,red,yellow);</code>

<p>Examples</p>

<code>linear-gradient(20deg,red,yellow);</code>

<code>linear-gradient(180deg,red,yellow);</code>

<p>You can also explicitly write where you want the direction of the gradient to go.  If you would like the end of the gradient to flow to the top right of your HTML element, you would write for it to go "to top right".</p>

<code>linear-gradient(to top right, red, yellow)</code>

<p>If you would like the gradient to flow straight to the bottom, you would tell it to go "to bottom"</p>

<code>linear-gradient(to bottom, red, yellow)</code>


<p><i>Position</i></p>

<p>In gradients, sometimes we want the first color to start at 10% of the element, and for the second color to start at 90% of the element.  By writing percents next to the color, we can do exactly that.</p>

<code>linear-gradient(red 10%, yellow 90%);</code>

<p>With one color starting at 10%, and the neighboring color starting at 90%, there will be a good amount of blending between the 2 colors.  However, the closer these percents are to each other, the more minimal the blending, and the line between the two colors becomes sharper.  For example, look at the difference between<br/>
 <code>linear-gradient(red 10%, yellow 90%);</code>
 <br/> and <br/>
 <code>linear-gradient(red 40%, yellow 60%);</code>

<img src = "images/blurry_vs_firm_line_gradients.png"/>

<p>Here is another example with 3 colors.  As you can see, red and yellow have a firm line between them. But, since blue is set at 90% farther away from the yellow, there is a larger amount of blending between blue and yellow.</p>

<code>linear-gradient(red 40%, yellow 45%, blue 90%);</code>

<p><img src = "images/3_color_percent_gradient.png" style = "height:300px;width:auto;"></p>

<p>We can also use pixels instead of percents. For example, if we wanted to create the same gradient effect above, we could do <code>background:linear-gradient(red 120px, yellow 135px, blue 270px);</code>  Since the square is 300px long, 120px is 40% of the div, 135px is 45% of the div, and so on.

<p>Here are some examples of gradients using the basic, direction and position attributes.</p>

<p><b>Radial Gradients</b></p>

<p>The radial gradient has its colors expanding from its origin in a circle pattern.  The origin by default is the center of the HTML element, but the user can also change the position of the origin.</p>

<img src = "images/radial_gradients.png"/>

<p>The basic format for a radial-gradient is:</p>

<code>radial-gradient(color,color);</code>

<p><b>Size</b></p>

<p>The user can control the size of the gradient circle by using these 4 keywords below, or pixels or percentages: 
	<ul>
		<li>closest-side</li>
		<li>closest-corner</li>
		<li>farthest-side</li>
		<li>farthest-corner</li>
	</ul>

<p>View the codepen below to view the differences.  For full explanations of these properties, view this page <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/radial-gradient">Radial gradients</a></p>

<p><b>Origin</b></p>

<p>The origin of a radial gradient can be distinguished as a circle or an ellipse, followed by its location in the HTML element.  This location can be distinguished by descriptive words such as "center", shown below, or by percentages indicating x and y values.</p>

<p>Format:</p>

<code>radial-gradient(x y, color, color)</code>
<code>radial-gradient(shape at x y, color, color)</code>

<p><b>Conic Gradients</b></p>

<p>Using conic gradients you can move the <i>origin of the gradient</i>, and how far the colors extend using <i>deg, grad, turn and rad</i>. When extending the gradients, instead of using a percentage for each color like in a linear gradient, you will use 2 numbers to denote the start and end of the color in the gradient.  You can view this example in "Conic gradient, determining range of colors" below.  The range of degrees available for use range from 0-360, around the origin of the conic gradient.  However, for the first and last color, you can just use 1 number to denote the range.  This is because the degrees used in the color after the first color, and the degrees used in the color before the last color, complete the range.  Here are the other code formats below.</p>

<p><b>Standard Conic Gradient</b></p>

<p><code>conic-gradient(color,color);</code></p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p><b>Conic gradient, determining range of colors</b></p>

<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
	<li>conic-gradient(red 20deg 30deg,color 30deg 100deg);</li>
	<li>conic-gradient(yellow 90deg, violet 0.75turn 1.0turn, green 300grad);</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Conic-gradient, changing the origin</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>conic-gradient(from 0.75turn at 20% 70%, blue, green, purple);</li>
	<li>conic-gradient(from 0deg at 25% 50%,red 10rad, orange 30deg, yellow);</li>

<h3 id="css-animation">CSS Animation</h3>

<p>CSS Animations are a great way to add pizazz to any site.  There are several animatable properties that you can find listed in the link below.  You can change the background, text color, border radius and more.  You can also move, rotate and change the shape of the element itself.</p>

<p>Please view the video below for a quick intro in CSS Animation</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HZHHBwzmJLk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties" target="_blank">Animatable CSS properties List</a>

<p>CSS Animation format</p>
<p><b>How to apply it to element</b></p>

<p>Below is the basic code format to apply an animation to an element.  For the animation property, you can set the name of the animation first, then the duration of the animation in seconds.

	<code>
		div{
			width:200px;
			height:200px;
			animation: changeColor 2s;
		}

		@keyframes changeColor {
			0%   {background-color: red;}
			100% {background-color: green;}
		}


	</code>
<p><b>Animation properties</b></p>

<ul>
	<li><b>animation-name:</b> The name of the animation.</li>
	<li><b>animation-duration:</b> How long the animation lasts.</li>
	<li><b>animation-delay:</b> How many seconds pass before the animation starts.</li>
	<li><b>animation-iteration-count:</b> How many times the animation plays.</li>
	<li><b>animation-direction:</b> Determines whether the animation plays forwards, in reverse, alternate(forwards then backwards) or alternate-reverse(backwards then forwards).</li>
	<li><b>animation-timing-function:</b> Determines the speed curve the animation plays at.</li>
		<p>There are several of these properties:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>ease - (Default setting) Animation begins slowly, quickens, then ends slowly.</li>	
			<li>linear - Same speed throughout.</li>	
			<li>ease-in - Slow beginning</li>
			<li>ease-out - Slow end</li>	
			<li>ease-in-out - Slow beginning and end</li> 
			<li>cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Custom easing function, different numbers in each slot denote how fast or slow the animation will go at that point in the animation.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Other properties include <i>step-start</i>, <i>step-end</i>, and <i>steps(n,n)</i>, but we will not be using them in this course.</p>


		</ul>
		<li>animation-fill-mode: Determines what the element will look like before and after the animation.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Forwards: The element will keep the stylings from the end of the animation.</li>
			<li>Backwards: The element will keep the stylings from the beginning of the animation.</li>
			<li>Both: The element follows the rules for both forwards and backwards.</li>
		</ul>

	<li><b>animation:</b> Instead of writing out all properties individually, you can use this property as a shorthand.  The properties would go in this order: <br/>
		animation: <i>name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode play-state;</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Animation</p>
<p>CSS transform</p>

<p>All Transform Values</p>

<p>Transforming elements allows you to move, rotate, change size and the visual look of the element.  Here are the 5 different transform properties below</p>

<ul>
	<li>translate</li>
	<li>rotate</li>
	<li>scale</li>
	<li>skew</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Translate</b></p>

<p>The translate function moves an element left, right, up, down, forward and backward.  Put differently, along the x, y and z axis.</p>

<p>Here are the 5 translate functions</p>

<ul>
	<li>translate(x,y,z);</li>
	<li>translate3d(x,y,z);</li>
	<li>translateX(value);</li>
	<li>translateY(value);</li>
	<li>translateZ(value);</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<p><i>Note: TranslateZ moves the element forwards and backwards. However, to see this effect, the <i>perspective</i> property needs to be applied to the parent element of the element you're trying to animate.  This is because the <i>perspective</i> property creates a 3d space.</i></p>

	<p>For example, lets say we set the perspective to 600px.  Since the untransformed HTML element starts at the center of the x,y,z axis, its coordinates are currently at 0.  That means, a perspective of 600px would set the user viewing the webpage 600px away from 0, or the HTML element.</p>

	<p>If you apply <code>translateZ(100px)</code> to the element, it will now move forward 100px towards the user, becoming bigger along the provided 600px perspective length.</p>
</div>

</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p><b>Scale</b></p>

<p>Instead if decreasing the size of the shapes by percentages, we use numbers.  If you were to scale a number scale(1), the element would stay the same size.  If you wrote scale(2), the element would double in size by their width and height.  Similairly, if you used -1 or -2 to denote the size, the scale would be the same, but the element would reverse itself. The format for all 3 scale functions are below</p>

<code>scaleX(x)</code>
<code>scaleY(y)</code>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>

<p><b class = "prompt">Open-ended Discussion</b></p>
<p>You will participate in an open-ended discussion with your fellow students.  Think of what you would like to do for your final project.  What is your subject?  What will you be animating?  How can you apply gradients to make the subject more compelling?  Submit your project proposal and be as detailed as you can, state what you think your difficulties will be in creating this project. All students are required to provide feedback to at least 2 project proposals.</p>

<p><b class = "prompt">A Graded Discussion</b></p>
<img src="images/gradient_prompt.png" style="height:250px;width:auto;">
<p><b><i>Note. You will not see other student's answers until you've posted your own gradient</i></b></p>
<p>Replicate the gradient above using CSS on your codepen account.  The box is 300px by 300px, and the colors used are red and blue. After you've created your gradient, post a link to your codepen in the discussion.</p>

<p><i>Hint. You can use background size to create multiple blocks</i></p>

@keyframes moveUp{
    50%{
        transform: translateX(200px);
    }
    100%{
        Transform: translateX(300px) rotateX(20deg);
    }
}
</pre></code>
